## bImPy

**bImPy** is a multi-dimensional image viewer and annotation tool built with Python. It started as a collection of tools to convert proprietary image files to Tiff and extracting acquisition parameters. But now it has become a graphical user interface for visualizing and editing annotations on top of volumetric images.

**bImPy** should be pronounced 'bimpee' but you can call it whatever you want.

## Disclaimer

We are developing bImPy in the open but the project is still in an early alpha stage, and there will be **breaking changes** with each release. Please follow along as we develop this exciting new software and feel free to try it out and contribute ideas and code.

This makes heavy use of [Python bio-formats][python-bio-formats] which in itself is excellent and is used by [Fiji][fiji]. Regrettably, bio-formats uses Java and requires the Python package [javabridge][javabridge]. If you run into problems installing or using bImpy, it is probably due to your Java installation.
