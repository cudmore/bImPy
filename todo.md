_preComputeAllMasks() on 'delete node', 'delete edge'

    need to rewrite to only set values > edited edge/node idx

make sure right-click to set type sets correct row (at least in nodes)

make type 'empty' show up blank

### search

add search name to constructor and call proper function in run()

be sure to add in

```
if not self.continueSearch:
				break
```

make sure search result table snaps image (Seems to snap for nodes?)



### line profile

fix updating when scrolling slices
